# MZ
Computation of Marcinkiewicz-Zygmund constants (shortened as MZ) and least squares/hyperinterpolation comparisons. It contains many rules of interest.

In particular it contains demos for
a) computation of MZ constants on unit-interval, unit-disk, unit-simplex, unit-square, unit-sphere, unit-cube;
b) comparisons between unfettered hyperinterpolation, classical hyperinterpolation and least-squares on unit-interval (based on Clenshaw-Curtis rule), unit-square (based on Padua-points rule), unit-cube (based on QMC rule).

There are many rules of interest:

a) interval: Gauss-Legendre, Clenshaw-Curtis, Fejer
b) disk    : product-rules, almost minimal rules
c) simplex : Stroud conical rules, almost minimal rules
d) square  : product rules, Padua points rules, Morrow-Patterson-Xu rules, QMC rules
e) sphere  : product rules, spherical designs (low degree of precision, see R. Womersley homepage for more)
f) cube    : product rules, QMC rules.

Furthermore we include orthornormal basis and their Vandermonde matrices.
